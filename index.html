        <h1>My Favourite Character</h1>

        <p> I like my character Meliodas because he is very caring , kind and strong. He supports his teammates in the series and never betrays anyone. I also like because of his piwers like full counter and his demon powers which makes him even more stronger.He has a lot of friends in the series like King, Ban , Elizabeth and hawk. But one thing I didn't like is he betrayed hisi father.</p>
